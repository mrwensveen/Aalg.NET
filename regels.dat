let us pray to
the seven lords of the night
and bless us with the ancient art
i cast my eyes up to the sky and see
a starless corrupted night
and await his return
we shall undo
the eternal black mistress
gazes into the depths of the mortal soul
i long for
the vampyric kiss
to erase my empty beliefs
who will know
the sages of old
drinking the blood of the unbelievers
we will chant songs of
everlasting victory
where gods fear to thread
In the middle of
the night
by the mountains of dreams
I am not sure about
life after this
but I will carry on
I know it sounds funny but I just cant stand
the pain
thats why I am easy
I watch the stars in
my hand
and dream myself free
The Arns approve of
sweet oblivion
however that hurts
Too many
mean motherfuckers
here on earth
Are you
a servant of God
getting worse every day
We are without
exuses
said the poet
i am the master of
nocturnal illusions
and find the truth in evil
they will see
the fires of heaven
and they will bear the everlasting guilt
we shall destroy
arne
and sacrifice his weak soul
i drown in
unbearable misery
where all gods wil die
now he is
satan
who will take my soul to hell
crucify
the christian liar
and his perverted world
let us eat
the twisted wrath
because diamonds are for the beings of rotten flesh
behold
the wounded woman
who adore anal penetration
metal for
demons
is metal from hell
Scanning the scene and the city tonight, looking for
you
to start up a fight
Bang your head against
the stage
like you never did before
tie a man to
his god
he may not walk for fear of falling foul to temptation
I will make
my puppets
dance like strings to be pulled and cut
But now I'm leaving
Texas
with a gun and a bottle of Jack
I'm just
a dreamer
with a gun in my hand
On the first day I brought her
flowers
and I will follow
The look behind your eyes conceals
a thin disguise
that is my prize
I have been touched by
something sick and unholy
I did it myself
Make me taste like
the way you are
with an empty heart
All my time in hell was spent with
a frozen stare
chained to the floor
Well I aim my gun at
the black
it is god to me
Loving you was like loving
the dead
it was like fucking the dead
I am dancing to
a scream
inside my head
God spits on
my soul
it is all I need
Honey you are
the image of me
and die in pain
as if it were the first time every night that
she
carved her seal in the flesh of life
for if I shall see
thy will
be done
grant me
the witchraft
of thy tongue
the moonlight froze in
the shadow of 666
like a siren weaving song
from the lilt of
choirs choking
where the vengeful dead belong
alone as
a stonecold altar
in the castle and its keep
My violence is
a dream
comming from a girl
I am not like
them
but I can pretend
You cast me back into
the pit
to prevent my holy task
I know theres no
stars
in my eyes
Noone survives disobeying
the chosen
in front of her eyes
go to
dallas
and take a left turn
lift your skinny
fists like antennas
to heaven
Its
my party
and I cry if I want to
I have found
happyness
in slavery
with a gun for
a lover
and a shot for the pain
Sounds of crying weeping will not save
your faith for bricks 
and dream of mortar
Some girls wander by mistake into 
the mess 
that scalpels make
I know youre fucking
someone else
you dont know
he hears
slave screams
but doesnt want to listen
i am
the hate you try to hide
and i control you
he was
death
in a tattered red coat
he dreamed up
a god
and called it christianity
i want to fuck
you
like an animal
everybody needs
a bosom
for a pillow
why should you fear
the shadowsouled
asked a voice
i just dont understand
those complexities
in your mind
buy me
coke
in the back of a mcdonalds
no one is closer to
rooie rakker
right now
from the depths of my soul I gaze upon
the blackened earth
where corpses feed the earth
the most ancient one saw
the despairing mortals
and cursed the eternal sorrow
from ivory towers the gods observe
the crucified bastard son
wearing the tainted crown
the angels cried for
all lost souls
burning in the all-consuming fires
the ancient darkness battled
the wretched lieges of the hated one
and spitted on the cross
we will vomit on
the enlightened ones
and their cursed book
hail to
the eternal lord of darkness
who will spread his diabolic wings
the hand of evil will obliterate
the followers of the inverted cross
and feast upon their rotting remains
